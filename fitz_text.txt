September weather expected at or near norms 
NYMEX natural gas contract adds 6.8 cents US over-the-counter coals opened the week on Sept. 16 with a 
slate of stable assessments, holding with average temperatures 
expected nationwide in this shoulder season.
S&P Global PointLogic data points to temperatures within 2 
degrees Fahrenheit of seasonal norms through the end of the 
month. The Northeast forecast follows that expectation, while 
Midcontinent temperatures could rise to 6 degrees above normal 
in the next week. Southeast temperatures are expected to stay at

Coal Trader Asian met coal market sees fresh trade  
at lower level; sellers await China’s return 
Oct-loading PLV sold at $180/mt FOB 
Indian mill seek offers for 30,000-35,000 mt Sep/Oct-
loading PMV Asian metallurgical coal prices were largely stable with a 
prime coal cargo sold at a lower level Sept. 16, although most 
sellers were on the sidelines awaiting China’s return after the 
Mid-Autumn Festival on Sept. 17.
Platts assessed Premium Low-Vol (PLV) Hard Coking Coal 
$1/mt lower on the day at $180/mt FOB Australia Sept. 16; PLV 
CFR China was assessed steady at $196/mt over the same 
time period.
A cargo was heard traded via globalCOAL at $180/mt FOB 
Australia, Sept. 16, for 70,000 mt of PLV coal with Peak Downs 
or BMA PLV in seller’s option, loading Oct. 10-19. The cargo was 
understood to be resold by an international steelmaker to an 
Asian trader.
An international steelmaker source said they believed the 
Australian prime coal market still has room for downward 
correction given the reselling interest for Q4-loading cargoes, 
on top of the position cargoes that traders are struggling to 
liquidate.
Another international steelmaker source, meanwhile, said it 
remains difficult to gauge market direction currently. “[It’s] purely 
[a] function [of] how China behaves,” the source said.
A seller source said it was holding back offers as multiple 
markets in Northeast Asia were away for holidays.
Despite expectations of a potential market rebound in China, 
the procurement of a full Panamax of forward-delivery cargo is 
still considered a “big bet” for Chinese mills, which are prioritizing 
cash flow management, the seller source said.
Pockets of demand were seen coming from India, where a 
steelmaker is poised to collect offers by Sept.16 for 30,000-
35,000 mt of Australian premium mid-vol coal loading in 
September/October.
Indian steel demand was still sluggish and such significant 
volume demand for coking coal was not expected to arise from 
the country in the near term, an Indian steelmaker said.
A source with another India-based end-user said offers were 
limited with sellers being inactive amid China’s absence.
The market direction is still quite unclear, the source said, 
adding even with China’s return, upside potential should be US FOB coal assessments, Sep 16 Kcal/kg NAR

coal volume at the Chinese ports.
The PLV trade on the day caught the attention from some 
China-based market participants.
A Chinese steelmaker source, who followed the trade, said 
a net-forward level is deemed suitable for procurement as it is 
only slightly above Yuan 1,600/mt on a DDP basis, which is more 
competitive than domestic PLV.
The source added they can only procure 10,000 mt should 
they decide to buy.
“It’s still hard for Chinese mills to commit to a full Panamax, 
and most would prefer to buy port stock in smaller quantities,” a 
Chinese trader said.
In the met coke segment, both the FOB China and CFR India 
prices were unchanged on the day.
With respect to the pending price hike for China’s domestic 
met coke, a local cokery source said the outcome would hinge on 
the steel product price movement after the holiday.

— Staff News Energy Transfer NGLs line catches  
fire near Houston, forcing evacuations 
20-inch pipeline carried Y-grade NGLs 
Fire expected to burn into the night 
Early reports of car in right of way before fire Local authorities in Houston ordered evacuations and shelter-
in-place orders Sept. 16 after an Energy Transfer pipeline carrying 
natural gas liquids caught fire.
The city of La Porte said its fire department responded at 9:55 
am CT to the fire, which occurred in the neighboring city of Deer 
Park. Authorities expect the fire to continue to burn for hours,

3 Deer Park Mayor Jerry Mouton said during a press conference 
Sept. 16.
“All of the product has to burn off,” Mouton said. First 
responders contained the fire, but it could burn “if not into 
tonight then tomorrow.”
Energy Transfer confirmed the fire occurred on a 20-inch line 
carrying Y-grade NGLs, saying that no injuries were reported. 
Local authorities later said one firefighter was treated for minor 
injuries.
Y-grade NGLs include ethane, propane, butane and natural 
gasolines, according to Energy Transfer product specifications 
and prices spiked as a result.
Platts propane values rose to 67.50 cents/gal, up Y on the 
day and the highest since Sept. 5, according to S&P Global 
Commodity Insights.
A position for propane entered the Platts Market on Close 
assessment process for the first time in a week, and traded at 
67.50 cents/gal, 4.75 cents/gal higher than the previous close. The 
price was last reported higher on Sept. 5 at 69.75 cents/gal.
“The line has been isolated so that the residual product in 
the line can safely burn itself out,” Energy Transfer spokesperson 
Cassidy Lamb said in a statement. “We have no timeline at this 
point on how long that process will take, but we are working 
closely with local authorities.”
The pipeline operator also said it was “aware of early reports 
indicating that an unknown passenger car entered our right of 
way and struck the [valve] location.”
Mouton acknowledged the presence of a vehicle near the 
burning pipeline but declined to speculate whether it caused 
the fire.
The Railroad Commission of Texas announced that its pipeline 
safety inspectors are also investigating the fire alongside local 
authorities. The regulator said the fire occurred within a pipeline 
corridor and that it is “notifying other pipeline operators in the 
corridor of the incident and getting information on measures they 
are taking to ensure safety of their systems.”

4 New York gets funding to expand EV fast charging, 
increasing power demand amid tighter supply 
$21 million available for DC fast chargers 
Preliminary NYISO study shows power market tightening New York makes $21 million available to install electric vehicle 
fast chargers along major corridors across the state with the 
sites required to have no less than 150 kW of capacity which will 
increase power demand, along with additional electrification 
efforts and the construction of several large load projects 
including data centers.
The EV charging initiative is being funded by a federal National 
Electric Vehicle Infrastructure grant, according to a Sept. 13 
statement from New York Governor Kathy Hochul’s office.
The state has created a competitive “Upstate NEVI 
Direct Current Fast Charger” program to help expand DCFC 
infrastructure making it easier for EV drivers to access a reliable 
charging network, the governor’s office said.
The first funding round focuses on locations along and 
north of Interstate 84, including parts of the state north to the 
Canadian border and west to Buffalo, the statement said.
The funding will be available to qualified infrastructure 
developers for installing and operating DCFC stations at one or 
more sites along Federal Highway Administration-designated 
“Alternative Fuel Corridors, or AFCs.
“Proposed sites must meet all federal requirements, including 
being located within one travel mile of an exit, being publicly 
accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and having the 
ability to charge at least four electric vehicles simultaneously,” 
according to the statement. Charging sites must also have no less than 150 kW of capacity 
and must meet federal uptime requirements regarding the 
percentage of time the charging stations are functional.
“As we make the transition away from [gasoline] gas-powered 
vehicles, New York is accelerating the number of electric vehicle 
fast chargers available to reduce harmful emissions and improve 
air quality in our communities,” Governor Hochul said. Platts daily metallurgical coal assessments, Sep 16 Atlantic coking coal ($/mt)

5 Grid operator reliability concerns
As the state moves ahead with multiple strategies to comply 
with its aggressive climate law, the Climate Leadership and 
Community Protection Act, a recent New York Independent 
System Operator power grid study has indicated the power 
supply is tightening.
New York is advancing measures to ensure that all new 
passenger cars and trucks sold be zero emissions by 2035, as 
well as having all school buses be zero emissions the same year, 
according to the statement.
The state is also working to electrify space heating in 
commercial buildings and homes, which will further increase 
power demand. At the same time, power demand is increasing 
due to construction of new industrial facilities and data centers.
A preliminary NYISO study has found the state could be at 
risk of insufficient power supplies of at least 1,000 MW by 2034 
due to increasing power demand as well as assumed natural gas 
unavailability.
Part of the concern is that while power demand is increasing 
from efforts to combat climate change and increase economic 
development, tighter regulations for gas-fired power plants are 
causing some power plants to retire, thus reducing supply while 
demand is increasing.
The NYISO study also found that there could be a New York 
City transmission security margin baseline deficiency starting 
in 2031 due to expected New York Power Authority small gas-
fired power plant retirements, growing to 275 MW by 2034 due 
to demand growth, according to preliminary Reliability Needs 
Assessment results.
By 2034, NYISO expects 2,821 MW of incremental power 
generation capacity to be added to the system and 1,216 MW to 
be removed. Additionally, power demand from large loads during 
the summer peak increases from 368 MW in 2024 to 2,268 MW by 
2034, with similar results for the winter peak.
Demand from EVs is forecast to increase from 1,124 GWh 
in 2024 to 36,937 GWh by 2044, according to NYISO data. 
Additionally, power demand from electrifying buildings is 
expected to outstrip power demand from EVs by around 2040.
By 2044, the combined power demand from EVs and building 
electrification is 81,821 GWh, up from a total of 1,378 GWh in 2024, 
NYISO data shows.

From a base of 372 GW global nuclear operational capacity 
at the end of 2023, the report looked at high and low estimates 
for likely nuclear power output by 2050, depending on policy and 
business actions.
“In the high case, global nuclear operational capacity is 
projected to increase to 2.5 times the current capacity, reaching 
950 GW by 2050,” the report said. In the low case, an increase of 
about 40% is predicted, taking total installed capacity to 514 GW 
in 2040.
SMRs would account for about a quarter (24%) of total 
installed capacity added between 2023 and 2050 in the high 
case. In the low case the capacity added by SMRs was 6%.
“SMRs have the potential to support smaller grids in 
developing countries, power electricity-hungry data centers, or 
even provide low-carbon propulsion for commercial shipping 
vessels,” IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said during the 
opening session of the organization’s general conference Sept. 
16. “But they still have challenges to overcome before they can be 
deployed,” he added, noting that the IAEA is promoting regulatory 
harmonization to make SMR deployment more efficient.

6 The IAEA said the high case is “plausible and technically 
feasible, and it is possible that capacity could increase beyond 
that projected.”
However, “enabling factors” needed to reach or exceed the 
high case predictions include “national policies and strategies,” 
in for instance “supporting investment, demonstration projects 
for new reactor technologies, investment in grids, supply chain 
management for reactor construction, regulatory collaboration 
and global harmonization (particularly for SMR development).”
In North America, the low case assumed 89 GW installed 
capacity in 2050, or 228 GW in the high case, compared with 109.5 
in 2023. For north, west and southern Europe, the 2050 low and 
high estimates figures are 69 GW or 135 GW, respectively. The low 
case represented a decline from 2023 levels of 93.8 GW.
Most growth would be seen in Central and Eastern Asia with 
207 GW in the low case and 297 GW in the high case, up from 91.9 
GW in 2023. Considerable growth was forecast in Eastern Europe 
and South Asia in both scenarios. Fossil fuels still dominate power mix
Hydro power and nuclear were the largest sources of “low 
carbon electricity” in 2023, the report said. Nuclear contributed 
9.2% of global electricity production in 2023, with hydro power 
adding about 15% although “its share has been gradually 
declining since 1980.” Wind and solar provided 13% in 2023.
“The share of hydro and nuclear has declined gradually over 
the past 30-40 years owing to a lack of investment,” the report 
found. However, “with a share of about 60%, fossil fuels — 
particularly coal — have remained dominant energy sources for 
electricity production since 1980.”
The report assumes that global final energy consumption will 
have dropped by 2% by 2050 and that electricity production will “more than” double.
European industry representatives Nuclear Europe said [in an 
email] they planned to publish their own report “in the coming 
weeks looking at what different nuclear capacity scenarios in 
2050 would bring as benefits to the European energy system.”

— Morgan Snook SOUTH KOREA DATA: August coal imports fall 5.5% 
on year on decline from small importers 
Australia replaces Indonesia as top supplier 
Indonesia, Russia coal exports to South Korea rise South Korean imports fell 5.5% on the year to 11.11 million mt in 
August due to a sharp decline in shipments from small importers 
and Australia, despite lower average landed prices, according to 
customs data seen Sept. 16.
The average landed price of total imports fell to $136.78/mt in 
August, from $145.95/mt in the year ago period, the data showed. 
The average landed price in July was $128.15/mt.
Even as Indonesia’s coal exports to South Korea rose 9.9% 
year on year to 2.49 million mt in August, Australia was the 
biggest supplier in August at 2.81 million mt exported. The 
average landed price of Australian thermal coal rose to $195.24/
mt in August, from $187.07/mt a year ago. However, the average 
landed price for Indonesian coal fell to $83.84/mt in August from 
$84.59/mt in the same month a year ago.
The average price of FOB Newcastle Australian 5,500 kcal/kg 
NAR stood at $87.33/mt in August, down from $87.80/mt in July, 
according to Platts assessments from S&P Global Commodity 
Insights. Platts assessed the price at $86.75/mt on Sept. 13.
Coal supplies from Mozambique and South Africa to South 
Korea fell sharply in August. Exports of coal from Mozambique 
plunged 67.7% on the year in August to 53,022 mt. Meanwhile, 
there were no exports of coal from South Africa to South Korea 
in August, compared to South Africa having sent 976,455 mt in 
August 2023.
Thermal coal prices fell in August due to sluggish demand 
from top importers. Rainfall in China and India, coupled with 
sufficient stocks at ports, reduced coal buying appetite from 
India and China, which decreased demand for spot cargoes. 
Market participants anticipated demand to pick up as rains 
subside and as China begins restocking for the winter season and 
building stocks for the upcoming festival season.
Russia was the third largest supplier to South Korea in August, 
sending 2.42 million mt of coal, up 6.2% on the year. The average 
landed price of Russian imports fell to $120.83/mt in August from $136.40/mt a year ago.
The Platts NEAT index assessment for 5,750 kcal/kg NAR 
delivered to Kinuura, Japan, on a CFR basis averaged $112.68/mt 
in August, up from $109.13/mt a year ago. This assessment is a 
popular price reference point for cargoes supplied in Northeast 
Asia, including to South Korea and Taiwan.
South Korea imported 119.46 million mt of coal in all of 2023, 
down from 125.15 million in 2022.
— Aditya Saroha Russia’s Rosatom says it could restart  
occupied Ukrainian nuclear plant 
Rosatom may put Zaporizhzhia back  
online following a two-year outage 
Likhachev blames Ukrainian authorities  
for damaging plant’s infrastructure 
Obligations under international contracts  
are fulfilled despite sanctions Rosatom is ready to start work on resuming operation of 
the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant controlled by Russian forces as 
soon as the military situation permits, Alexey Likhachev, CEO of 
Russian state nuclear company Rosatom, said Sept. 16.
Speaking at the International Atomic Energy Agency 
general conference in Vienna, Likhachev did not elaborate on 
the conditions necessary for the plant to resume generating 
electricity, only stressing the plant’s physical safety and security 
were Rosatom’s “unconditional priority.” He added that the 
Russian nuclear company ensures a constant thermal, water, and 
power supply to the facility.
Rosenergoatom, Rosatom’s department for Russian nuclear 
plant management, shut Zaporizhzhia-6, the last unit at the 
nuclear plant remaining in operation at that time. Rosenergoatom 
cited mounting security concerns as a rationale behind the 
decision.
The Zaporizhzhia plant has been under the control of the 
Russian troops since early March while remaining near the 
frontline and suffering from constant shelling.
On Oct. 6, Putin issued a decree to transfer the plant to 
Rosatom. Ukraine described the decree as illegal and called on 
Western countries to impose sanctions against Rosatom.
Likhachev blamed the Ukrainian authorities for “reckless 
actions,” which he emphasized “threaten not only Russia 
but also the entire nuclear energy” industry. The threats 
are not potential, and some of them have fully materialized, 
referring to “recorded damage” to the plant’s infrastructure, 
social facilities and “places where plant employees live,” 
he added.
Ukraine has also threatened the Kursk nuclear plant in Russia, 
Likhachev stated. Ukrainian forces have taken over a portion of 
the region in which that plant is located.
“Kyiv’s behavior requires an adequate response, including from 
international organizations,” he said.
US OTC coals open week with unchanged finishes ...from page 1 All assessed prompt-month and -quarter coals remained 
at parity.
Platts assessed Central Appalachian 12,500 Btu/lb CSX rail 
coal for October delivery at $73.50/st, a number influenced 
by broker indications of value at $74.50/st and $72.50/st. The 
assessment has held in the last four sessions. Prompt-quarter 
CAPP rail coal drew identical indications.
Illinois Basin 11,500 Btu/lb barge coal for October has held at 
$40.50/st for a week, an assessment influenced by indications at 
$41.25/st and $39.75/st.
The Powder River Basin coals have held their assessments 
throughout prompt-month October. PRB 8,800 Btu/lb for October 
drew indications of value at $13.90/st and $14/st on its way to a 
$13.95/st assessment. Prompt-month and -quarter PRB 8,400 
fuels continued at $11.40/st.
All coal assessments were tested in the market until 
4:30 pm ET. The day’s movement for OTC coal interests came from the 
NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas market, which added 6.8 cents 
to finish at $2.373/MMBtu. One year ago, the contract stood at 
$2.644/MMBtu.

9 The IAEA has stationed observers at Zaporizhzhia in an effort 
to support nuclear safety. It has called for a halt to fighting 
around all nuclear plants in the region, and has supported 
the Ukrainian nuclear regulator’s decision to order all units at 
Zaporizhzhia shut due to safety concerns.
Ukrainian authorities have blamed Russia for damage to 
Zaporizhzhia and surrounding transmission infrastructure.
Likhachev also said Rosatom was committed to fulfilling 
its obligations under international agreements “despite 
unprecedented and illegal sanction pressure.”
“None of our construction projects have been stopped,” 
Likhachev said. Rosatom commissioned Ostravets-2 in Belarus in 
2023 and is proceeding with large-capacity nuclear plant projects 
in Bangladesh, Egypt, Hungary, Iran and Turkey, he added.
Rosatom’s press office confirmed Likhachev’s comments, 
initially carried on Russian state media, in an email Sept. 16, but 
declined to provide additional comments.
